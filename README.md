## About NutriSense

NutriSense is an intelligent, interactive web platform addressing the critical lack of authentic nutrition data for diverse Indian diets. It helps users effortlessly search, filter, and understand comprehensive nutritional breakdowns (macros, vitamins, fiber) for Indian meals, empowering healthier eating by transforming guesswork into informed decisions.

## Key Features

NutriSense is designed as a **smart, interactive website** with the following core functionalities:

* **Comprehensive Indian Food Database:** Built from `foods.json`, offering detailed nutrition for Indian dishes.
* **Advanced Search & Filtering:** Dynamic search and extensive filters (nutritional ranges, categories, cuisines, dietary restrictions).
* **Intuitive User Interface & Responsive Design:** Easy-to-navigate layout that adapts seamlessly across all devices.
* **Detailed Nutritional Breakdowns:** Presents granular data beyond simple calorie counts for "actual data that matters."
* **Empowering Decisions:** Helps users make informed choices, eliminating guesswork in daily nutrition.

## Tech Stack

Built with **HTML5** (structure), **CSS3** (styling & responsiveness), and **Vanilla JavaScript** (all interactive logic). All food data is stored locally in **`foods.json`**. It's a 100% client-side "Single Page Application" (SPA) â€“ meaning everything runs in your browser without a backend server, making it fast and easy to deploy on platforms like GitHub Pages. We also used Font Awesome for icons, Google Fonts for typography, and Formspree for our contact form.
