## One-Liner Problem Solution Gist
**NutriSense is an intelligent, interactive web service that empowers people to make informed, personalized Indian meal nutrition decisions by providing comprehensive, easy-to-interpret analysis of macro/micronutrients and fiber, extending beyond mere calorie counting to simplify healthy eating for the masses.**

---

## Problem Statement
In multicultural India, food is deeply intertwined with tradition, culture, and identity. However, this rich gastronomic diversity presents a challenge: **the lack of accessible, affordable, and authentic nutrition information**. Global nutrition monitoring primarily focuses on Western diets, leaving us unaware of the specific health effects of our Indian diet. This information gap creates significant barriers to well-being, impacting everything from diabetes control to the ability to make genuinely healthier food choices.

---

## Brief Project Description
We envision **NutriSense** as a direct solution to this problem. It will be a **smart, interactive website** designed to help users search, browse, and filter food items based on comprehensive nutrition information. Featuring an **easy-to-navigate interface** and **visual cues**, NutriSense will empower users to make wiser decisions about their food intake patterns. More than just a calorie tracker, it will be a **nutrition tracker specifically focused on Indian meals**, providing actual data that truly matters, including detailed breakdowns of macronutrients, vitamins, fiber, and calorie levels. Ultimately, NutriSense aims to **bring healthy eating to the masses, eliminating the need for guesswork in daily nutrition.**
